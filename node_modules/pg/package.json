Pure JavaScript and native libpq bindings.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install pg\n       \n## Examples\n\n### Simple\n\nConnect to a postgres instance, run a query, and disconnect.\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg'); \n//or native libpq bindings\n//var pg = require('pg').native\n\nvar conString = \"postgres://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n\nvar client = new pg.Client(conString);\nclient.connect(function(err) {\n  if(err) {\n    return console.error('could not connect to postgres', err);\n  }\n  client.query('SELECT NOW() AS \"theTime\"', function(err, result) {\n    if(err) {\n      return console.error('error running query', err);\n    }\n    console.log(result.rows[0].theTime);\n    //output: Tue Jan 15 2013 19:12:47 GMT-600 (CST)\n    client.end();\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n### Client pooling\n\nTypically you will access the PostgreSQL server through a pool of clients.  node-postgres ships with a built in pool to help get you up and running quickly.\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg');\nvar conString = \"postgres://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres\";\n\npg.connect(conString, function(err, client, done) {\n  if(err) {\n  \treturn console.error('error fetching client from pool', err);\n  }\n  client.query('SELECT $1::int AS numbor', ['1'], function(err, result) {\n    //call `done()` to release the client back to the pool\n    done();\n    \n    if(err) {\n      return console.error('error running query', err);\n    }\n    console.log(result.rows[0].numbor);\n    //output: 1\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is a work in progress primarily taking place on the github WIKI\n\n### [Documentation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki)\n\n## Native Bindings\n\nnode-postgres contains a pure JavaScript driver and also exposes JavaScript bindings to libpq.  You can use either interface.  I personally use the JavaScript bindings as the are quite fast, and I like having everything implemented in JavaScript.\n\nTo use native libpq bindings replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.\n\nThe two share the same interface so __no other code changes should be required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `pg` to `pg.native`, please report an issue.\n\n## Features\n\n* pure JavaScript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_\n* optional connection pooling\n* extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion\n* supported PostgreSQL features\n  * parameterized queries\n  * named statements with query plan caching\n  * async notifications with `LISTEN/NOTIFY`\n  * bulk import & export with `COPY TO/COPY FROM`\n\n## Contributing\n\n__I love contributions.__\n\nYou are welcome contribute via pull requests.  If you need help getting the tests running locally feel free to email me or gchat me.\n\nI will __happily__ accept your pull request if it:\n- _has tests_\n- looks reasonable\n- does not break backwards compatibility\n- satisfies jshint\n\nInformation about the testing processes is in the [wiki](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Testing).\n\nIf you need help or have questions about constructing a pull request I'll be glad to help out as well.\n\n## Support\n\nIf at all possible when you open an issue please provide\n- version of node\n- version of postgres\n- smallest possible snippet of code to reproduce the problem\n\nUsually I'll pop the code into the repo as a test.  Hopefully the test fails.  Then I make the test pass.  Then everyone's happy!\n\n\nIf you need help or run into _any_ issues getting node-postgres to work on your system please report a bug or contact me directly.  I am usually available via google-talk at my github account public email address.\n\nI usually tweet about any important status updates or changes to node-postgres.  \nFollow me [@briancarlson](https://twitter.com/briancarlson) to keep up to date.\n\n\n## Extras\n\nnode-postgres is by design _low level_ with the bare minimum of abstraction.
