Pure JavaScript and optional native libpq bindings.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\n$ npm install pg\n```\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Client pooling\n\nGenerally you will access the PostgreSQL server through a pool of clients.  A client takes a non-trivial amount of time to establish a new connection. A client also consumes a non-trivial amount of resources on the PostgreSQL server - not something you want to do on every http request. Good news: node-postgres ships with built in client pooling.\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg');\nvar conString = \"postgres://username:password@localhost/database\";\n\npg.connect(conString, function(err, client, done) {\n  if(err) {\n    return console.error('error fetching client from pool', err);\n  }\n  client.query('SELECT $1::int AS number', ['1'], function(err, result) {\n    //call `done()` to release the client back to the pool\n    done();\n    \n    if(err) {\n      return console.error('error running query', err);\n    }\n    console.log(result.rows[0].number);\n    //output: 1\n  });\n});\n```\n\n[Check this out for the get up and running quickly example](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Example)\n\n### Client instance\n\nSometimes you may not want to use a pool of connections.  You can easily connect a single client to a postgres instance, run some queries, and disconnect.\n\n```javascript\nvar pg = require('pg');\n\nvar conString = \"postgres://username:password@localhost/database\";\n\nvar client = new pg.Client(conString);\nclient.connect(function(err) {\n  if(err) {\n    return console.error('could not connect to postgres', err);\n  }\n  client.query('SELECT NOW() AS \"theTime\"', function(err, result) {\n    if(err) {\n      return console.error('error running query', err);\n    }\n    console.log(result.rows[0].theTime);\n    //output: Tue Jan 15 2013 19:12:47 GMT-600 (CST)\n    client.end();\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## [More Documentation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki)\n\n## Native Bindings\n\nTo install the [native bindings](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-native.git):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install pg pg-native\n```\n\n\nnode-postgres contains a pure JavaScript protocol implementation which is quite fast, but you can optionally use native bindings for a 20-30% increase in parsing speed. Both versions are adequate for production workloads.\n\nTo use the native bindings, first install [pg-native](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-native.git).  Once pg-native is installed, simply replace `require('pg')` with `require('pg').native`.\n\nnode-postgres abstracts over the pg-native module to provide exactly the same interface as the pure JavaScript version. __No other code changes are required__.  If you find yourself having to change code other than the require statement when switching from `require('pg')` to `require('pg').native` please report an issue.\n\n## Features\n\n* pure JavaScript client and native libpq bindings share _the same api_\n* optional connection pooling\n* extensible js<->postgresql data-type coercion\n* supported PostgreSQL features\n  * parameterized queries\n  * named statements with query plan caching\n  * async notifications with `LISTEN/NOTIFY`\n  * bulk import & export with `COPY TO/COPY FROM`\n\n## Contributing\n\n__We love contributions!__\n\nIf you need help getting the tests running locally or have any questions about the code when working on a patch please feel free to email me or gchat me.\n\nI will __happily__ accept your pull request if it:\n- __has tests__\n- looks reasonable\n- does not break backwards compatibility\n\nInformation about the testing processes is in the [wiki](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Testing).\n\nOpen source belongs to all of us, and we're all invited to participate!\n\n## Support\n\nIf at all possible when you open an issue please provide\n- version of node\n- version of postgres\n- smallest possible snippet of code to reproduce the problem\n\nUsually I'll pop the code into the repo as a test.  Hopefully the test fails.  Then I make the test pass.  Then everyone's happy!\n\nIf you need help or run into _any_ issues getting node-postgres to work on your system please report a bug or contact me directly.  I am usually available via google-talk at my github account public email address.\n\nI usually tweet about any important status updates or changes to node-postgres on twitter.  \nFollow me [@briancarlson](https://twitter.com/briancarlson) to keep up to date.\n\n\n## Extras\n\nnode-postgres is by design pretty light on abstractions.  These are some handy modules we've been using over the years to complete the picture:\n\n- [brianc/node-pg-native](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-native) - Simple interface abstraction on top of [libpq](https://github.com/brianc/node-libpq)\n- [brianc/node-pg-query-stream](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-query-stream) - Query results from node-postgres as a readable (object) stream\n- [brianc/node-pg-cursor](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-cursor) - Query cursor extension for node-postgres\n- [brianc/node-pg-copy-streams](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-copy-streams) - COPY FROM / COPY TO for node-postgres.
